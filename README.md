# Classes Manager

This is a JavaFX application developed as a required activity for the Java Programming Languague Course at IFSP. 

Its purpose was to put into practice Java and OOP concepts learned throughout the course, by prototyping a simple app that aims to help teachers/professors to manage their different classrooms by including students, activities and assigning grades to students in each activity.
